title: Hidden lives of Surburbia

<p>Today we'll be using the methods of biographical criticism to analyze some works of John Cheever a famous writer who lived between the 1910s and early 1980s. Here in my first blogpost of any kind are subsections devoted to either the stories, important pieces of his life or basic biographical information about him</p>
<h2>A Dive Into The Life Of John Cheever</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John William Cheever, was born in Quincy, Massachusetts on May 27 1912.  He was the second child of his father, Frederick Lincoln Cheever, and his mother, Mary Deveraux Liley.  He was born into an upper middle class family. He went to the boarding school named Thayer Academy in 1926, like most children of upper middle class or higher families of that era. He was lucky, for he did not have to work to support his family, during a period where a large percentage of children worked in the factories or sweatshops or on farms.  His family later lost their house after the crash that marked the start of the Great Depression. The Cheevers would go on to jump from place to place, living in rentals or with family.  His parents were separated for a time but got back together and would then subsist off running a gift shop that usually made a portion of the money from selling possessions they accumulated from before the crash.  In his later years he settled down and had a family. He married Mary Winternitz, and had two children named Benjamin Cheever and Susan Cheever. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet there is so much more to this man from our history and as I delved into his letters and interviews I found him to be a fascinating case study of the duality of man. His son noticed numerous differences between how he interacted with people and how he wrote about them in his letters.   Much of it intriguing and even humorous, and that compelled me to dig further.  I have arranged my observations in subsections for this blog. </p>
<h2>The Man I Thought I Knew, The Letters of John Cheever</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something that stands out above the rest is an observation his son made while assembling the collection of John Cheever’s Letters. At one point Cheever had written to Frederick Exley about a time he swallowed his false tooth, which had a plastic backside and two sharp hooks.  He writes dramatically asking why such a man of his caliber could ever be taken down by a false tooth.  A week later he writes again, telling his dentist that he passed the false tooth with hooks. And at the end he says, and I quote, “It is true that when I fart these days it sounds like a police whistle but I suffer little pain and it’s very easy for me to get cabs.”(19, Cheever)  John seemed to enjoy telling stories even if they were very unlikely, as of course he said the dentist said it was impossible to pass without medical assistance.  And his son Benjamin recalled when the incident occurred. He actually lost it in their pool.  It turned up later in their filtration system.  This along with multiple other recollections starts to paint a picture for how John Cheever approached life and writing.  How factual it was, wasn’t really important.  A few lies here and there that don’t matter that much, and are okay. The story was what was important. </p>
<h2>To Rewrite One’s Own Story</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was asked about when he was expelled from Thayer Academy.  And he stated it was intentional. Wasn’t exciting, wasn’t a crime of passion or mistake.  He wanted to leave the school.  I believe his intention partially was to manipulate the reality of his situation in his favor.  Like he writes in his short story Expelled published by The New Republic, how it wouldn’t be as bad if his character left for having to work, or being sick.(Expelled).  I believe it is impossible to separate the character in Cheever’s Expelled with Cheever himself. Both the character and Cheever suffered from poor marks in their respective schools. In fact it is known Cheever once transferred to Quincy High in 1928 from Thayer Academy, and was brought back on academic probation after winning a short story contest, which then lead to the aforementioned expulsion mentioned above.   They are partially based on his experiences and influenced by the ideas he gains from education and observation of our environment. It is definitely no coincidence that the first work John Cheever published was about a boy getting expelled from a college preparatory school. However it diverged from stated reality, the boy was unwilling to apply himself and gain the marks necessary to maintain his grade, and so was expelled for that reason.  Instead of being expelled for smoking, like John stated he did intentionally.  And he chose to go out the way he did to tell a better story, and then used his experience from school, of course, to write a brilliant piece of fiction for The New Republic.</p>
<h2>A Real Dr. Jekyll, and Mr. Hide</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it turns out the man held many a secret for quite some time.  Confirmed both in his interview with The New York Times, and the collection of letters his son assembled, the details of the relationship were unclear; but he had a very intimate and close relationship with his brother that was noticeable while they stayed together in Massachusetts.  He had very conflicting feelings about it and it reflected somewhat in his work on the novel Falconer; as numerous other critics and people following his work have noticed.it. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later on in life he discovered he was bisexual, and in the 1940s his marriage was on the rocks, leading to a complicated home life.   Numerous letters of correspondence of his were sent out to some of his liaisons. One of them was Allan Gurganus, a graduate student at the University of Iowa where John Cheever worked for a time.  He wrote an excessive number of letters to him throughout March 1974; displaying a deep affection for the man and remembrance of times when they were together.  He was working with Allan to get some work of his titled Minor Heroism, published in The New Yorker.  They also spoke of his failing marriage with Mary. It is some of the first concrete evidence from a primary source that proved John was bisexual.</p>
<p><br>I believe that his bisexuality likely was discovered at a very early age, which may have led to the complicated and intimate relationship he described he had with his brother.  However due to the times anything that wasn’t straight was frowned upon, shunned, blacklisted, bullied, even tortured during the very conservative 1930s through to the 1960s (not to forget the possible if not probable incest being just wrong in any era).  Having grown up in a conservative family— that was also barely functional—he developed the typical aversions towards being anything other than straight and expressed hatred towards those who were gay, or other things. I never discovered if he harbored any racial animus and so will leave that out of any discussion on the matter. Anyway, it’s likely that he developed the cognitive dissonance necessary to hold these views while being bisexual himself. That led to a self-hatred that forced him to hide a part of who he was from his family and his peers.  Everyone says you shouldn’t keep secrets.  But anyone with half a brain knows if the secret destroys the entire life you built for yourself and the person you want everyone to think you are, the motivation just isn’t there to be honest.  It’s understandable for someone in his position to hide those feelings, it may not be ethically or morally right, sadly the world doesn’t care much about ethics or morality, not even the priests or preachers were held to such a high standard during this time period let alone in modern times.<br></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a psychological point of view, it’s probable that a man of his intellect couldn’t quite handle dealing with such conflicting ideals.  Cognitive dissonance allows you to do a lot of things. Becoming aware of them, however, makes life difficult; and it’s easy to see a man who wrote and got his first short story published at 17 in a reputable paper to be quite aware of a great many things.  Awareness, guilt, regret, and feelings of disgust can also be suppressed through alcohol use.  It is possible that these conflicting emotions and ideals led him to drink more.  But it’s also just as likely he was genetically predisposed to higher risk of increased alcohol consumption and addiction.</p>
<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His life became full of secrets and managed personalities, becoming the hypocrite he so disdained.  The hate he had for those like him was great, but still he determined himself unique and different from others with his tastes. A concept many come to believe to help explain away the hypocrisy within their personal beliefs.</p>
<h2> A Radio Unlike Any Other</h2>
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/oldradio1.png)
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of John Cheever’s famous works was The Enormous Radio.  It was published in The New Yorker on May 17, 1947.  It takes place in a setting familiar to John Cheever, between the early 1920s when the first commercial radios started pumping out of factories and the 1940s when TV was just starting to take off.  Their old radio no longer worked, and Jim, husband of Irene Westcott bought her an enormous radio that takes up quite a bit of space in their living room.  They start fiddling with it after finally being assembled and to their surprise, instead of picking up radio signals; it picks up the conversations being had throughout their apartment complex. Jim shrugged it off and didn’t want to snoop on the lives of his neighbors.  Irene soon became intoxicated by the prospect of hearing about her neighbors and was snooping via the radio day after day.  She didn’t want anyone else to know about it so had begun to listen to it in secret.  And this story was published at a time close to when his alternative life was becoming more overt just 3 years before the letters he wrote to Allan Gurganus.  The secrets Irene learned had also begun to depress her.  But nonetheless she kept listening.  Soon she ran to her husband in a hysterical fashion, crying and upset about the awfulness of the world’s curtains now open to her. Her husband demanded her to stop listening to the radio, and she begs him not to fight over this, desperately asking him for the truth, wanting it to prove that their lives are nothing like their friends and neighbors.  They begin to fight more, revealing secrets of their own pasts.  As the fight went on, the radio’s interference from the conversations and bickering amongst the other tenants had gone silent.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the story was to remove the shroud of amicability that surrounds many suburban communities of the middle class in America. The lies we tell each other and ourselves just to get by.  Hidden behind the friendly luncheons, dinner parties, and the stories we tell friends, family and ourselves, is a truth we’d rather not see, let alone acknowledge as existing.  As Irene says the world is truly awful in many ways.  Some were fortunate but the story took place near the beginning of an economic downturn similar to the crash that affected John Cheever’s family.  Jim wanted to get something while he could to make his wife happy, and distract her from the problems the family faced as his work and pay were drying up, while she continued to spend like they had no issues. And in the end, John reveals the hypocrisy and lies to us within their own relationship, even though Irene thought as much as hoped there were none.  Many of the themes within this story were also experienced by John Cheever’s family.  He tried to hide his secrets from his family, but of course that only served to drive more conflict within it, leading to the marital troubles he spoke about in his letters to Allan.  The purpose of this story was to reveal to the reader that behind the amicability that we show others and ourselves, lie numerous contradictions we all struggle with every day.  And rather than change, or solve these issues, we’d rather cover them up, distract ourselves, and continue to take the path that is easiest for us. </p>
<h2>An Expression of One’s Own Experiences</h2>
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/funeral.png)
<p>In The Death of Justina, John Cheever begins with a character suffering from strikingly similar ailments as his own. His character is suffering from withdrawal from the cessation of the same substances Cheever indulges in.  The discontinuation of alcohol and cigarettes had proven almost unbearable for him.  And later in the week he finds out his cousin Justina had died.  His wife calls him and as he leaves work to deal with it, his boss demands he stay and finish writing a commercial for him; even though he just informed him of the death of a family member.  
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second half of the story delves into the issues of local governance.  The protagonist is now unable to dispose of the body of his family member due to zoning laws. The issue had come about due to the town’s zoning laws, like many suburbs had begun doing at the time. The town’s leaders practiced what we call nowadays as N.I.M.B.Y or not in my backyard.  That is, the town’s efforts to prevent anything unsightly, ghettoish, or untamed from bringing down the property values the residents all held so dear due to their greed.  In their haste they not only banned cemeteries and funeral homes, but banned the act of dying!  Something that could have been easily fixed but no one cared enough to bother. The situation was quickly remedied through forceful negotiation with the mayor threatening to bury her himself if he did not get the exception necessary to get an undertaker to remove her and transport her to a morgue.  And yet this isn’t the most intriguing part.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the story shortly after the negotiation, our protagonist has a dream.  Everyone there is assembled in lines with wagons at a supermarket to purchase items.  They were all of a sight we all laugh, cringe, and pass judgement on, as they wore clothes that clashed with their age, gender, and culture.  The people are unenthused, as they meander through aisles and counters grabbing unmarked consumer goods.  Which upon reaching the end of the lines, were opened by men with a “face so full-blown in its obdurate resistance to the appeals of love, reason, and decency, so lewd, so brutish and unregenerate, that you turn away” (Cheever, 260). I believe this dream to be a representation of what the worst of humanity has to offer and how it affects our society.  The intent of Cheever here was to show to the reader how people’s secrets are received and treated.  The lack of identification of what any of the materials were, showed that it didn’t matter what your secrets, your necessities, your choice of bread from the bakery was.  They would all be inevitably seen and judged with a sick pleasure to it.  At which point you would be discarded and left in the darkness, the darkness a representation of death, loss of community, family, or job, or everything.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The story finally ends with the man fed up with the system, he intentionally mocked the work his boss asked him to do until he could finally return home; having gotten himself fired on purpose, to escape the system that treated him with disrespect and apathy while giving his boss everything and receiving nothing in return. It is a representation of the average worker’s contribution to corporate America not being given adequate compensation.  Their work is used to prop up and provide for their higher ups, and no matter how much you do, it didn’t matter because all work you do is seen by everyone else that has any say in the matter as done by the person taking credit for it. Like in The Enormous Radio, the character or characters in both works don’t work to solve the overall cause of their problems.  The protagonist here just intentionally gets himself fired, to avoid the problem instead of facing it; just like he does earlier in getting his cousin removed from his home and buried.</p>
  <h2> John Cheever’s Contribution</h2>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John Cheever’s life was filled with endless conflict, whether through his own choices or the choices around him.  Through this conflict Cheever chose to enlighten us of the ails hiding beneath the shining smile we show to everyone.  He showed us a world that doesn’t care about you, that uses you for its own purposes; those purposes rarely being one of any decent virtue. Perhaps through this exposure of that which we shroud in darkness, we could learn from it, and change things for the better.  But Cheever isn’t here to provide solutions or answers to our problems.  His stories aren’t supposed to have happy endings.    His life is definitely an intriguing one.  But all I see is something similar to what Martin Luther King Jr. said about the white moderate. A person who would prefer to uphold the status quo through inaction while being fully aware of the problems, than risk changes that could affect them personally.   And while he is an engaging stepping stone to a better understanding of part of the human condition, and an interesting dive into early suburban life; I felt saddened that his works didn’t encourage you to fix the problems in early 20th century America, but either work around or accept them. As he said in his New York Times interview, that to think the only writing worthwhile is one that enacts social change is “rubbish”, it appears that the story was more important than pushing for any change in the world.  However for any solutions to be found, someone must first elucidate the problem. And that I believe is why Cheever’s work is worth reading.  To be the first step towards change, you have to be aware of the problem to begin with.</p>
