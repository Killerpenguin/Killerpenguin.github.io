<p>Today we'll be using the methods of biological criticism to analyze some works of John Cheever a famous writer who lived between the 1910s and early 1980s. Here in my first blogpost of any kind are subsections devoted to either the stories, important pieces of his life or basic biographical information about him</p>
<h2>A Dive Into The Life Of John Cheever</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John William Cheever, was born in Quincy, Massachusetts on May 27 1912.  He was the second child of his father, Frederick Lincoln Cheever, and his mother, Mary Deveraux Liley.  He was born into an upper middle class family. He went to the boarding school named Thayer Academy in 1926, like most children of upper middle class or higher families of that era. He was lucky, for he did not have to work to support his family, during a period where a large percentage of children worked in the factories or sweatshops or on farms.  His family later lost their house after the crash that marked the start of the Great Depression. The Cheevers would go on to jump from place to place, living in rentals or with family.  His parents were separated for a time but got back together and would then subsist off running a gift shop that usually made a portion of the money from selling possessions they accumulated from before the crash.  In his later years he settled down and had a family. He married Mary Winternitz, and had two children named Benjamin Cheever and Susan Cheever. <br>Yet there is so much more to this man from our history and as I delved into his letters and interviews I found him to be a fascinating case study of the duality of man. His son noticed numerous differences between how he interacted with people and how he wrote about them in his letters.   Much of it intriguing and even humorous, and that compelled me to dig further.  I have arranged my observations in subsections for this blog. </p>
<h2>The Man I Thought I Knew, The Letters of John Cheever</h2>
<p> Something that stands out above the rest is an observation his son made while assembling the collection of John Cheever’s Letters. At one point Cheever had written to Frederick Exley about a time he swallowed his false tooth, which had a plastic backside and two sharp hooks.  He writes dramatically asking why such a man of his caliber could ever be taken down by a false tooth.  A week later he writes again, telling his dentist that he passed the false tooth with hooks. And at the end he says, and I quote, “It is true that when I fart these days it sounds like a police whistle but I suffer little pain and it’s very easy for me to get cabs.”(19, Cheever)  John seemed to enjoy telling stories even if they were very unlikely, as of course he said the dentist said it was impossible to pass without medical assistance.  And his son Benjamin recalled when the incident occurred. He actually lost it in their pool.  It turned up later in their filtration system.  This along with multiple other recollections starts to paint a picture for how John Cheever approached life and writing.  How factual it was, wasn’t really important.  A few lies here and there that don’t matter that much, and are okay. The story was what was important. </p>
<h2>To Rewrite One’s Own Story</h2>
<p>He was asked about when he was expelled from Thayer Academy.  And he stated it was intentional. Wasn’t exciting, wasn’t a crime of passion or mistake.  He wanted to leave the school.  I believe his intention partially was to manipulate the reality of his situation in his favor.  Like he writes in his short story Expelled published by The New Republic, how it wouldn’t be as bad if his character left for having to work, or being sick.(Expelled).  I believe it is impossible to separate the character in Cheever’s Expelled with Cheever himself. Both the character and Cheever suffered from poor marks in their respective schools. In fact it is known Cheever once transferred to Quincy High in 1928 from Thayer Academy, and was brought back on academic probation after winning a short story contest, which then lead to the aforementioned expulsion mentioned above.   They are partially based on his experiences and influenced by the ideas he gains from education and observation of our environment. It is definitely no coincidence that the first work John Cheever published was about a boy getting expelled from a college preparatory school. However it diverged from stated reality, the boy was unwilling to apply himself and gain the marks necessary to maintain his grade, and so was expelled for that reason.  Instead of being expelled for smoking, like John stated he did intentionally.  And he chose to go out the way he did to tell a better story, and then used his experience from school, of course, to write a brilliant piece of fiction for The New Republic.</p>
