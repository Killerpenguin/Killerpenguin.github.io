<p> To work is to be stressed, for some that stress is manageable, others, impassable. For what comes with work is the pressure of everything.  To succeed, to live up to expectations, not just others, your own, and for writers your own expectations seem impossible to meet. For every path you take to seeing your vision realized, the road is not quite what you envisioned. </p>
